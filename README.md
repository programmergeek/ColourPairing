# Colour Pairing

The premise of the project was to create a web app that would make pairing and comparing colours easier. The web app, as it is now, would have the best user experience on a 15inch screen and the worst on mobile devices. It was not made to be used on mobile.

I plan on improving on this at a later point, but as it is, this is useable for my purposes.
